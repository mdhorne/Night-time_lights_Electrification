# Night-time_lights_Electrification
Project funded by the World Bank Group and ESMAP to estimate electricity access rate with night-time lights and other satellite-based datasets in developing countries.

The code provided downloads night-time lights data (NTL, VIIRS from NOAA) from Google Earth Engine and correct the inter-annual shift in noisiness using population data.
